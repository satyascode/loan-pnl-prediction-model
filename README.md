Loan Profit and Loss Prediction ML model
----------------------------------------------------
This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan profit or loss percentage based on a set of feature. 

In this project we will explore various regression models levergaing data analysis, feature engineering, and model tuning methods to achieve high accuracy in profit or loss prediction.  

Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------
The primary goal of this project is to take a raw financial dataset and transform it into a robust machine learning model. 

The process will involve several key stages: 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the data and identify patterns.
- Determine the success metrics: To translate the business goals into ML problem
-
